Downloading:
a) using git:
    git clone git://github.com/asherikov/oru_walk_module.git
    git submodule update --init
b) without git:
    1) download all modules separately:
        http://github.com/asherikov/oru_walk_module/downloads
        http://github.com/asherikov/smpc_solver/downloads
        http://github.com/asherikov/nao_igm/downloads
    2) put smpc_solver and nao_igm in the corresponding directories 
       in oru_walk_module.

Compilation:
    make cmake TOOLCHAIN=<path to the toolchain>

    to build a debug version add 'DEBUG=1' to the command line above

Running:
    1) Set the following environment variables:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH <path to the sdk>/lib
    PYTHONPATH  <path to the sdk>/lib

    2) Add the name of the module to 'autoload.ini' file used by naoqi.
    Note, that if you use naoqi on a PC, you need to make sure, that
    'devicecommunicationmodule' is also loaded.
