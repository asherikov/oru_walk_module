This is a walking module for NAO humanoid robot.
NAO is developed by Aldebaran Robotics: http://aldebaran-robotics.com/
The company provides a more advanced walking module, but its sources
are not publicly available. Furthermore, we use a different approach
to control the robot. 

The module depends on two libraries: nao_igm and smpc_solver. All sources
are published on github.
