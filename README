This is a walking module for NAO humanoid robot.

NAO is developed by Aldebaran Robotics: http://aldebaran-robotics.com/
The company provides a more advanced walking module, but its sources
are not publicly available. Furthermore, we use a different approach
to control the robot. 

The module depends on two libraries: nao_igm and smpc_solver. All sources
are published on http://github.com/asherikov. The detailed description of 
the logic of the module is given in the MS thesis, which is available on 
    http://asherikov.github.com/Projects/naowalk.html

Note, that if you want to build the module you need SDK or crosscompilation
toolkit provided by Aldebaran Robotics.

Refer to INSTALL file for instructions on installation process.
