This is a walking module for NAO humanoid robot.

NAO is developed by Aldebaran Robotics: http://aldebaran-robotics.com/
The company provides a more advanced walking module, but its sources
are not publicly available. Furthermore, we use a different approach
to control the robot. 

The module depends on two libraries: nao_igm and smpc_solver. All sources
are published on github. Visit http://asherikov.github.com/Projects/naowalk.html
for more information.

Note, that if you want to build the module you need SDK or crosscompilation
toolkit provided by Aldebaran Robotics.

Refer to INSTALL file for detailed instructions on installation process.
